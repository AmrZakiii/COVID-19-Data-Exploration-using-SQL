This is a data exploration project that analyzes COVID-19 data using SQL. The project includes queries that extract and transform data from two datasets: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations. The project aims to provide insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need to have access to a SQL server and the two datasets: CovidDeaths.csv and CovidVaccinations.csv. You can find these datasets in the data folder of this repository.

Data Exploration
The queries in this project explore various aspects of the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations datasets. Some of the topics covered in the queries include:

Total cases and deaths per country
Countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population
Global COVID-19 numbers
Total population vs new vaccinations per day
Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

data/CovidDeaths.csv: a CSV file containing data on COVID-19 deaths by country
data/CovidVaccinations.csv: a CSV file containing data on COVID-19 vaccinations by country
queries.sql: a SQL file containing the queries used to explore the data
